0,22nd May 2023,irresponsible airline,Not Verified ," The worst and irresponsible airline I have ever seen or had. My friend and I had a ticket of Air India from Vancouver to Delhi on May 21st. The flight had delay for 14 hours and finally they canceled that. They don't care about people, infants and elderly people at all. A very irresponsible and unorganized airline. I don't suggest this airline to anyone.",Air India,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to Delhi,May-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
1,22nd May 2023,Pathetic experience,Trip Verified ," Pathetic experience as the seats were not clean, no screens were working in the row E, the food was not tasty, half of the cuisine was made with corns only. Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment. Air India needs to improve a lot on their quality.",NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Toronto via Frankfurt,May-23,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,no
2,22nd May 2023,Seats are not at all hygienic,Trip Verified ,  I am really disappointed with international travel with Air India from London Heathrow to Delhi. there is no any improvement in flight comfort. Every time their video display are not working and very rarely its starts all of sudden and again stop working in between. No provision of headphones. Seats are not at all hygienic and not kept clean. Restrooms cleanliness not maintained its too unhygienic.,NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,Apr-23,1,4,4,1,3,1,1,no
3,22nd May 2023,No Inflight Entertainment,Not Verified ,"  No Inflight Entertainment. When I asked the staff regarding this they clearly said that the airline knew about this and they have taken the aircraft from the Hangar and deployed it. The journey was 12 hours and with no in flight entertainment, it was a nightmare. The return journey from Delhi to Melbourne was the same if not worse. No7 Inflight entertainment again, No reclining seats. With my ticket purchase I paid to have the In flight entertainment as a part of what this airline advertised. This is False advertising",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Mumbai,May-23,1,3,3,1,3,1,1,no
4,8th May 2023,disappointed that I never got to fly,Trip Verified ,  Boarding was on time took my seat and relaxed with a glass of champagne. Announcement was made we have a tech issue and power was turned off. After approx 20min had to deboard then after 5hrs waiting in the gate lounge they announced that the flight was cancelled.

5,7th May 2023,the flight was so horrible,Trip Verified ,"  Delhi to San Francisco and the flight was so horrible. First time I was traveling by Air India and I will not recommend anyone to travel by Air India. The seat is so tight space (not comfortable), the entertainment system was broke down in the entire flight (almost 17hrs non stop journey). I ordered Muslim food when I booked the ticket but on the plane during my journey I was not given the Muslim/halal food. The food I was given was not eatable.

6,5th May 2023,Such a bad experience,Not Verified ,My flight was scheduled rom Amritsar to Delhi and from Delhi to New York. The flight was delayed to the point that  every passenger missed their connecting flights. On top of this i had another flight from New York to Vancouver the next day which I missed and had a book a new flight for 400$. I talked to the airline staff and they said that the flight to Vancouver is not with their airline so they couldn't provide me any compensation. They didn't even care to look for any other flights from Amritsar to Delhi to help the passengers catch their connecting flights. Such a bad experience that I'll never travel with this airline in future no matter what. e.,NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amritsar to New York via Delhi,May-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
7,4th May 2023,Absolutely primitive aircraft,Trip Verified ,"  Absolutely primitive aircraft, None of the on-Board Audio systems work. You've to look at the sky or blank screen to spend time. Crew and their services were good, helpful. However, they can't fix everything on broken Aircrafts. Ticket prices are not any way cheaper than competitors flying to Kolkata. Except the Middle Seats in the Economy sections, one has to pay to get windows or aisle seats. It's not cheap, costs CAD 61.90.

15,28th April 2023,Would never fly again,Trip Verified ,"  Would never fly again. Didn't have a working screen for the whole flight and wasn't the only one on board who didn't, 2 of the 3 screens in the row were broken. When I pressed the buzzer for assistance it went unanswered for 40 minutes and eventually had to get someone, despite crew resetting the screens they remained broken and they didn't offer any further assistance. My seat also didn't recline which was very uncomfortable for sleeping. The flights were not cheap. I contacted them about my complaints and received no answer so they clearly don't care about customer service. The food was good and the only positive thing I can say.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sydney via Delhi,Jul-22,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,no
16,27th April 2023,not friendly to customers,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on AI171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick on 20 th April and during beverages I asked cabin crew for two cans of beer, so was served.

19,19th April 2023,an excellent flight,Trip Verified ,"  I have read mixed reviews of this flight. But it was an excellent flight with top notch service.  It was a proper three course meal. The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.  I understand that because of 2-3-2 seating, there was privacy issue.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to New York,Mar-23,5,5,5,3,5,NA,5,yes
20,16th April 2023,nervous about our journey back home,Trip Verified ,"  For our 3 seats the entertainment units were not working, for my seat the headset was not working and I was told to just read the subtitles by the team member and that this would definitely keep me entertained! My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight. The entertainment units not working on a day flight was frustrating, however the team members words were infuriating for us. The bathrooms were a mess throughout the journey and the crew were not keen to tidy them up. service was slow but professional. Admittedly nervous about our journey back home next week.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to New Delhi,Apr-23,4,2,4,1,4,NA,3,no
21,14th April 2023,Terrible customer service,Trip Verified ,"  Terrible customer service. Will choose to never fly with them again. The aircraft entry staff is predatory, will make demands on charging for carry on and laptop bag even when items bought are only from duty free and within reasonable amounts of weight. The flights are always overbooked and staff at the doors are unhelpful if any queries are raised.",NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Kathmandu,Apr-23,2,1,NA,NA,1,1,2,no
22,14th April 2023,entertainment non existent,Not Verified ,"  Check in was smooth, website works, staff at counters were ok including those in Seoul. Food average. Domestic connections were ok and food served was hot.  Inflight announcements - poor audio quality, grammar and mistakes in announcement including time, does not look professional. Cabin heads were both male and generally invisible. Safety only on screen, only one out of pop down screens worked. In one case my inflatable was on the ground. Onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wife's worked, touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work. Headphones are not provided, both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them. They said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years. Food was bad and Rice was undercooked. No hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers. Staff - good to average. Tokyo flight unresponsive and rude , opposite on my Seoul flight.

23,12th April 2023,Will not fly Air India again,Not Verified ," Flew business class in Feb to New Delhi and back in March from Delhi to Vancouver. Aircraft is old and the seats didn't work. All broken. No TV's and the food was bad, expected a better service when flying business class. Can't imagine what economy would be. Bathroom were dirty, no soap or napkins. It seems like they don't really care knowing that People like to fly direct and they are the only option. Will not fly Air India again. Overhead bins were opening during turbulence. Felt very unsafe. On another note, staff did try their best and were very polite.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to Vancouver,Mar-23,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,no
24,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,Mar-23,4,3,2,1,4,NA,2,yes
25,7th April 2023,Never flying Air India again,Trip Verified ,  Probably the worst airline. I flew from the Milan airport to New Delhi. The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional. Never flying Air India again.,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to New Delhi,Apr-23,1,4,1,1,3,NA,1,no
26,6th April 2023,unfair and bad service,Not Verified ," My flight was from Milan to Hyderabad and it was horrible with the baggage policy.

28,5th April 2023,reluctant to help in any way,Not Verified ,  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India. There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline. They simply said we cannot help you.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi,Dec-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,1,no
29,4th April 2023,Nothing was working at all,Trip Verified ,"  Rusty old broken aircraft. Ground staff at Vancouver airport misguided me for not upgrading my flight to business so unable to upgrade my tickets and suffered a flight in economy class. Booked seats by paying extra money and seats were the worst. Broken arms broken entertainment system. Nothing was working at all. For 15 hrs of the flight we just sitting looking at blank’s screen. Very very poor aircraft, rusty or cushions broken seats, useless entertainment systems.Even though business and economy seats were vacant the crew were not able to provide us alternatives which is a shame. I will never ever travel again on Air India flights and would never recommend anyone using it.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Delhi,Apr-23,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,no
30,3rd April 2023,scammed me for such a huge amount,Trip Verified ,  I first travelled in May 2022 and had return flight Aug 20th 2022. As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show? Literally there’s no other answer they have which is clearly they are lying and basically scammed me for such a huge amount?,NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Tel Aviv,May-22,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,no
31,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

33,30th March 2023,Extremely disgusted by Air India,Trip Verified ," Flight from Kolkata, which was supposed to depart at 6.40 am was delayed due to technical difficulties till 11.30. All passengers, myself included, missed their connecting flights and the airline in no way gave even a shred of consideration for something that is entirely their fault.

34,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good. I would gladly fly them if there are improvements in the IFE and cabin cleanliness.",Boeing 787-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bangkok,Oct-22,4,4,4,2,4,NA,3,yes
35,24th March 2023,IFE screen does not work,Not Verified ,"  I wish I can go with o stars. Flight was announced late of 2 hours and then another 3 hours unofficially. Sad thing is flight waited for cabin crew for an hour or so. The IFE screen does not work and no one knows where we are in air as maps also does not show on main display. Even family back home does not know exact ETA as airline is not providing exact information online. In Delhi, no one cares as other connecting flight is missing . Next flight is after 8 hours.

37,21st March 2023,Air India did not disappoint,Trip Verified ,"  We bumped up to first class for our 37th wedding anniversary. From beginning to end, on our 14+ hour flight to India, Air India did not disappoint. The entire cabin crew was very friendly and welcoming, including the pilots. Tenzen, our flight attendant was awesome in every way. She made us feel like family. We will definitely be using Air India on our future trips.

39,18th March 2023,not a good customer experience,Trip Verified ,"  Worst customer service. They don’t stick to their word. Our bags suppose to get delivered by March 15th 2023. When we requested at Hyderabad airport on March 14, they said - bags are coming in next flight and will directly ship your address. When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18. I really want to understand - what service these guys are maintaining. If something happened during the journey (in our case delay in baggage) you will end up hours of time to following up with customer care. For sure it is not a good customer experience.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Hyderabad via Delhi,Mar-23,1,3,2,1,1,NA,1,no
40,16th March 2023,Worst experience ever,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled with Air India for return flight on March 6th, 2023 from Delhi to Tokyo. I had an additional luggage for which they made me pay $400CAD for only one 23kg bag, which unacceptable. As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

44,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline.

After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
46,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
47,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do. Complete disgrace. Every time I fly this airline I regret it.",NA,Business,Economy Class,Mumbai to New York,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
48,9th March 2023,the seats did not recline,Not Verified ,"  The flight was on-time, leg room was not bad, the in-flight stewardesses were attentive, check-in was efficient with the generous baggage allowance (one of the main reasons, I opted for Air India) and baggage was delivered promptly. However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Mangalore,Feb-23,2,4,1,NA,4,NA,4,yes

51,3rd March 2023,Service gone so down,Trip Verified ,"  I was flying with my friends, flight was packed. None of seat screen was working, no one listening to say sorry about this. When food was serving, staff were asking all what would you like have Veg or Non veg? As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.

Return flight changed 1 day before (text and phonecall) Actually to a better time but on the day 50min delay at least 30min of which was standing in a corridor. Seat was creaky and uncomfortable.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering.

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing!

55,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
56,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

59,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

64,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line?

They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable.

In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

Seats were poorly maintained in both sectors to and from AI 144 - from EWR to BOM ( Seat No 37 C) AI 191 - from BOM to EWR ( Seat No 39D) Seats : Broken / no USB connectors / no flight entertainment overall very bad experience. Food : For the money paid and for preselected option at the time of booking you are given what is available on flight.

Change of date of flying on short notice and worst the message wasn't updated and showed the original date of flying, change of route, instead of my non stop flight, the airline changed with stop over. Delay of take off for more than 5 hrs and not even a single refreshment or water served while waiting more than 1 hr seated in aircraft.

91,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

93,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi,Jan-23,1,1,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
94,8th January 2023,Air India is disgusting,Trip Verified ,  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Surat,Jan-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
95,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers. I have already had 2 negative experiences travelling on the airline within the space of 2 months.",A320 neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Jan-23,4,4,4,NA,3,NA,4,no

You’d never come across a staff smiling (ground or air), the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the Govt owned airline. Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

128,5th April 2023,reluctant to help in any way,Not Verified ,  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India. There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline.

As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show?

131,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

134,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18.

As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

144,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
145,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
146,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok.

147,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious.

The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference!

155,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
156,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days.

She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help.

164,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

After not getting a response for an hour after pressing the call button, I asked a flight attendant passing by about my query. She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

They cancel international flights (AI144 from EWR to BLR for Feb 17th, 2023) with less than 21 hours in-advance of the scheduled departure. This has turned my world and plans upside down. Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

They were asking for extra Money (15$ Usd) for luggage which we checked in for baby.

Everything was okay for us other than not informing us for flight was late. When we asked them about our next flight connection, they had no answer about it. When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation.

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability.

178,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

191,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

193,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it.

195,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

The flight was delayed to the point that  every passenger missed their connecting flights. On top of this i had another flight from New York to Vancouver the next day which I missed and had a book a new flight for 400$. I talked to the airline staff and they said that the flight to Vancouver is not with their airline so they couldn't provide me any compensation. They didn't even care to look for any other flights from Amritsar to Delhi to help the passengers catch their connecting flights.

Didn't have a working screen for the whole flight and wasn't the only one on board who didn't, 2 of the 3 screens in the row were broken. When I pressed the buzzer for assistance it went unanswered for 40 minutes and eventually had to get someone, despite crew resetting the screens they remained broken and they didn't offer any further assistance.

The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.

My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight.

Onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wife's worked, touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work. Headphones are not provided, both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them. They said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years. Food was bad and Rice was undercooked. No hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers.

224,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,Mar-23,4,3,2,1,4,NA,2,yes
225,7th April 2023,Never flying Air India again,Trip Verified ,  Probably the worst airline. I flew from the Milan airport to New Delhi. The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional.

There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline.

As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show?

231,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

234,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18. I really want to understand - what service these guys are maintaining.

I had an additional luggage for which they made me pay $400CAD for only one 23kg bag, which unacceptable. As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

244,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
245,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
246,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
247,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

248,9th March 2023,the seats did not recline,Not Verified ,"  The flight was on-time, leg room was not bad, the in-flight stewardesses were attentive, check-in was efficient with the generous baggage allowance (one of the main reasons, I opted for Air India) and baggage was delivered promptly. However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Mangalore,Feb-23,2,4,1,NA,4,NA,4,yes
249,5th March 2023,Horrible service,Not Verified ,"  Horrible service, the aircraft had a technical issue and no one informed the passengers about the fault.

251,3rd March 2023,Service gone so down,Trip Verified ,"  I was flying with my friends, flight was packed. None of seat screen was working, no one listening to say sorry about this. When food was serving, staff were asking all what would you like have Veg or Non veg? As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.  Service gone so down - very poor when they charge a lot. Not worth money to spend on Air India.",Boeing 787-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Amritsar,Mar-23,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Return flight changed 1 day before (text and phonecall) Actually to a better time but on the day 50min delay at least 30min of which was standing in a corridor. Seat was creaky and uncomfortable. Food was below average quality. Service was polite and efficient. Overall I would only go Air India if the price was good which to be fair it was, but I would probably pay a bit more for a better experience if available.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Goa,Mar-23,2,4,3,1,3,NA,3,yes

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering. Not a good value for money considering the tickets are so expensive.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangalore to Delhi,Mar-23,1,3,2,2,2,NA,1,no

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing!

255,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
256,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

259,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

260,24th February 2023,unexpected and unhappy experience,Not Verified ,"  Recently travelled with my 2 months baby and old-age mom and had very unexpected and unhappy experience with the flight attendant. Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

Said no to that and then finally the manager said she would get me on a seat the next day, while looking into that she said one seat had become vacant since a passenger had dropped out, finally after 2.5 hrs, got a boarding pass, only to find that the flight had 7 empty seats. On the flight after a small snack, no food was served for the next thirteen hours, since I was hungry asked for a sandwich.

264,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger. This is surely not tailored for a Western traveller, do avoid at all costs and pay the extra 500 dollars, it's worth it.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Melbourne via Delhi,Feb-23,1,1,1,1,1,NA,1,no

After not getting a response for an hour after pressing the call button, I asked a flight attendant passing by about my query. She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

To my surprise I had to wait for longer time than people who did not do check on line as there were more counter for people who did not do the on line so it was a big failure on part of Air India.

Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation.

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability.

278,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

293,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi,Jan-23,1,1,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
294,8th January 2023,Air India is disgusting,Trip Verified ,  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Surat,Jan-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
295,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

334,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18.

As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

344,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
345,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
346,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
347,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked).

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference!

355,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
356,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

359,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

364,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

372,17th February 2023,non-customer friendly company,Trip Verified ," We have so much love and respect Tata and hence chose this air-line. They cancel international flights (AI144 from EWR to BLR for Feb 17th, 2023) with less than 21 hours in-advance of the scheduled departure. This has turned my world and plans upside down. Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

373,16th February 2023,a worst experience with check-in,Trip Verified ,"  I had connecting flight with Air India from Delhi to Kathmandu. I had a worst experience with check-in officers, they didn’t give us boarding pass showing unnecessary reasons about baggage that we had checked in at Chicago airport. They were asking for extra Money (15$ Usd) for luggage which we checked in for baby. They also asked for our vaccination card which they didn’t even see, they were just trying to check if we have that or not. They were not checking vaccination cards for other passengers though.

When we went to the airport for check-in, we came to know that our flight was 4 hours late and they said basinet seat is not available. Everything was okay for us other than not informing us for flight was late. When we asked them about our next flight connection, they had no answer about it. When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation. It was a horrible experience for us that they are not happy to understand the situation of their customer.  Customer service desk people are hopeless, they are not happy to listen anything as it is our problem that our air India flight was late. Never travel with this airline.

377,10th February 2023,Disgusting airline,Trip Verified ,"  Denied boarding AI0489 Delhi to Surat Air India removed us from our flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent, the next flight is 24 hours later.  I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability.

378,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

391,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

393,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it.

395,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

Didn't have a working screen for the whole flight and wasn't the only one on board who didn't, 2 of the 3 screens in the row were broken. When I pressed the buzzer for assistance it went unanswered for 40 minutes and eventually had to get someone, despite crew resetting the screens they remained broken and they didn't offer any further assistance. My seat also didn't recline which was very uncomfortable for sleeping. The flights were not cheap. I contacted them about my complaints and received no answer so they clearly don't care about customer service.

419,19th April 2023,an excellent flight,Trip Verified ,"  I have read mixed reviews of this flight. But it was an excellent flight with top notch service.  It was a proper three course meal. The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.

My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight. The entertainment units not working on a day flight was frustrating, however the team members words were infuriating for us. The bathrooms were a mess throughout the journey and the crew were not keen to tidy them up. service was slow but professional.

Onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wife's worked, touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work. Headphones are not provided, both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them. They said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years. Food was bad and Rice was undercooked. No hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers.

424,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,Mar-23,4,3,2,1,4,NA,2,yes
425,7th April 2023,Never flying Air India again,Trip Verified ,  Probably the worst airline. I flew from the Milan airport to New Delhi. The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional.

There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline.

Booked seats by paying extra money and seats were the worst. Broken arms broken entertainment system. Nothing was working at all. For 15 hrs of the flight we just sitting looking at blank’s screen.

As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show? Literally there’s no other answer they have which is clearly they are lying and basically scammed me for such a huge amount?,NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Tel Aviv,May-22,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,no
431,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

434,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18. I really want to understand - what service these guys are maintaining. If something happened during the journey (in our case delay in baggage) you will end up hours of time to following up with customer care.

I had an additional luggage for which they made me pay $400CAD for only one 23kg bag, which unacceptable. As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

444,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
445,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
446,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
447,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious.

As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering. Not a good value for money considering the tickets are so expensive.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangalore to Delhi,Mar-23,1,3,2,2,2,NA,1,no

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing!

455,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
456,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

459,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

Said no to that and then finally the manager said she would get me on a seat the next day, while looking into that she said one seat had become vacant since a passenger had dropped out, finally after 2.5 hrs, got a boarding pass, only to find that the flight had 7 empty seats.

464,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line?

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable.

In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

491,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting.

493,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi,Jan-23,1,1,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
494,8th January 2023,Air India is disgusting,Trip Verified ,  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Surat,Jan-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
495,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.

The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best.

After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account.

531,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone.

On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

Sad thing is flight waited for cabin crew for an hour or so. The IFE screen does not work and no one knows where we are in air as maps also does not show on main display. Even family back home does not know exact ETA as airline is not providing exact information online. In Delhi, no one cares as other connecting flight is missing . Next flight is after 8 hours.

When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18. I really want to understand - what service these guys are maintaining. If something happened during the journey (in our case delay in baggage) you will end up hours of time to following up with customer care.

I had an additional luggage for which they made me pay $400CAD for only one 23kg bag, which unacceptable. As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

544,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
545,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
546,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
547,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do. Complete disgrace. Every time I fly this airline I regret it.",NA,Business,Economy Class,Mumbai to New York,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Mangalore,Feb-23,2,4,1,NA,4,NA,4,yes

As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering.

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing!

555,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
556,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

559,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

564,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line?

When we went to the airport for check-in, we came to know that our flight was 4 hours late and they said basinet seat is not available. Everything was okay for us other than not informing us for flight was late. When we asked them about our next flight connection, they had no answer about it. When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation. It was a horrible experience for us that they are not happy to understand the situation of their customer.  Customer service desk people are hopeless, they are not happy to listen anything as it is our problem that our air India flight was late. Never travel with this airline.

577,10th February 2023,Disgusting airline,Trip Verified ,"  Denied boarding AI0489 Delhi to Surat Air India removed us from our flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent, the next flight is 24 hours later.  I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability.

578,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

591,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

593,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it.

595,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

619,19th April 2023,an excellent flight,Trip Verified ,"  I have read mixed reviews of this flight. But it was an excellent flight with top notch service.  It was a proper three course meal. The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.  I understand that because of 2-3-2 seating, there was privacy issue.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to New York,Mar-23,5,5,5,3,5,NA,5,yes

My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight. The entertainment units not working on a day flight was frustrating, however the team members words were infuriating for us. The bathrooms were a mess throughout the journey and the crew were not keen to tidy them up. service was slow but professional.

621,14th April 2023,Terrible customer service,Trip Verified ,"  Terrible customer service. Will choose to never fly with them again.

622,14th April 2023,entertainment non existent,Not Verified ,"  Check in was smooth, website works, staff at counters were ok including those in Seoul. Food average. Domestic connections were ok and food served was hot.  Inflight announcements - poor audio quality, grammar and mistakes in announcement including time, does not look professional. Cabin heads were both male and generally invisible. Safety only on screen, only one out of pop down screens worked. In one case my inflatable was on the ground. Onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wife's worked, touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work. Headphones are not provided, both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them. They said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years. Food was bad and Rice was undercooked. No hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers. Staff - good to average. Tokyo flight unresponsive and rude , opposite on my Seoul flight.

All broken. No TV's and the food was bad, expected a better service when flying business class. Can't imagine what economy would be. Bathroom were dirty, no soap or napkins. It seems like they don't really care knowing that People like to fly direct and they are the only option. Will not fly Air India again. Overhead bins were opening during turbulence. Felt very unsafe.

624,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,Mar-23,4,3,2,1,4,NA,2,yes
625,7th April 2023,Never flying Air India again,Trip Verified ,  Probably the worst airline. I flew from the Milan airport to New Delhi. The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional.

626,6th April 2023,unfair and bad service,Not Verified ," My flight was from Milan to Hyderabad and it was horrible with the baggage policy.

628,5th April 2023,reluctant to help in any way,Not Verified ,  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India. There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline. They simply said we cannot help you.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi,Dec-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,1,no
629,4th April 2023,Nothing was working at all,Trip Verified ,"  Rusty old broken aircraft. Ground staff at Vancouver airport misguided me for not upgrading my flight to business so unable to upgrade my tickets and suffered a flight in economy class. Booked seats by paying extra money and seats were the worst. Broken arms broken entertainment system. Nothing was working at all. For 15 hrs of the flight we just sitting looking at blank’s screen. Very very poor aircraft, rusty or cushions broken seats, useless entertainment systems.Even though business and economy seats were vacant the crew were not able to provide us alternatives which is a shame.

630,3rd April 2023,scammed me for such a huge amount,Trip Verified ,  I first travelled in May 2022 and had return flight Aug 20th 2022. As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show? Literally there’s no other answer they have which is clearly they are lying and basically scammed me for such a huge amount?,NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Tel Aviv,May-22,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,no
631,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

634,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good. I would gladly fly them if there are improvements in the IFE and cabin cleanliness.",Boeing 787-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bangkok,Oct-22,4,4,4,2,4,NA,3,yes
635,24th March 2023,IFE screen does not work,Not Verified ,"  I wish I can go with o stars. Flight was announced late of 2 hours and then another 3 hours unofficially. Sad thing is flight waited for cabin crew for an hour or so. The IFE screen does not work and no one knows where we are in air as maps also does not show on main display. Even family back home does not know exact ETA as airline is not providing exact information online. In Delhi, no one cares as other connecting flight is missing . Next flight is after 8 hours.

636,22nd March 2023,Flight was clean and neat,Trip Verified ,  Air India surprised me with the service for the price. Flight was clean and neat.

From beginning to end, on our 14+ hour flight to India, Air India did not disappoint. The entire cabin crew was very friendly and welcoming, including the pilots. Tenzen, our flight attendant was awesome in every way. She made us feel like family. We will definitely be using Air India on our future trips.

639,18th March 2023,not a good customer experience,Trip Verified ,"  Worst customer service. They don’t stick to their word. Our bags suppose to get delivered by March 15th 2023. When we requested at Hyderabad airport on March 14, they said - bags are coming in next flight and will directly ship your address. When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18. I really want to understand - what service these guys are maintaining. If something happened during the journey (in our case delay in baggage) you will end up hours of time to following up with customer care.

640,16th March 2023,Worst experience ever,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled with Air India for return flight on March 6th, 2023 from Delhi to Tokyo. I had an additional luggage for which they made me pay $400CAD for only one 23kg bag, which unacceptable. As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

644,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
645,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
646,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
647,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do. Complete disgrace. Every time I fly this airline I regret it.",NA,Business,Economy Class,Mumbai to New York,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Mangalore,Feb-23,2,4,1,NA,4,NA,4,yes

When food was serving, staff were asking all what would you like have Veg or Non veg? As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering.

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing!

655,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
656,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

659,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

664,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable.

678,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

691,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting.

693,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it.

695,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins.

You’d never come across a staff smiling (ground or air), the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the Govt owned airline. Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.

My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight.

724,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating.

The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best.

731,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone.

On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18.

744,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
745,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
746,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
747,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Mangalore,Feb-23,2,4,1,NA,4,NA,4,yes

As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked).

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference!

755,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
756,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

759,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days.

She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

764,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable.

778,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.

791,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

793,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

794,8th January 2023,Air India is disgusting,Trip Verified ,  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Surat,Jan-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
795,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

824,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,Mar-23,4,3,2,1,4,NA,2,yes
825,7th April 2023,Never flying Air India again,Trip Verified ,  Probably the worst airline. I flew from the Milan airport to New Delhi. The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional.

There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline.

As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show?

831,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience.

834,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18.

As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip.

844,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
845,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name.

846,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok.

Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked).

The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference!

855,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
856,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

859,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

860,24th February 2023,unexpected and unhappy experience,Not Verified ,"  Recently travelled with my 2 months baby and old-age mom and had very unexpected and unhappy experience with the flight attendant. Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"".

After much argument they tried putting me on a next day flight to Chicago, with in hotel to stay nor any transport. Said no to that and then finally the manager said she would get me on a seat the next day, while looking into that she said one seat had become vacant since a passenger had dropped out, finally after 2.5 hrs, got a boarding pass, only to find that the flight had 7 empty seats. On the flight after a small snack, no food was served for the next thirteen hours, since I was hungry asked for a sandwich.

864,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger. This is surely not tailored for a Western traveller, do avoid at all costs and pay the extra 500 dollars, it's worth it.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Melbourne via Delhi,Feb-23,1,1,1,1,1,NA,1,no

After not getting a response for an hour after pressing the call button, I asked a flight attendant passing by about my query. She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

To my surprise I had to wait for longer time than people who did not do check on line as there were more counter for people who did not do the on line so it was a big failure on part of Air India.

They cancel international flights (AI144 from EWR to BLR for Feb 17th, 2023) with less than 21 hours in-advance of the scheduled departure. This has turned my world and plans upside down. Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

I had a worst experience with check-in officers, they didn’t give us boarding pass showing unnecessary reasons about baggage that we had checked in at Chicago airport. They were asking for extra Money (15$ Usd) for luggage which we checked in for baby. They also asked for our vaccination card which they didn’t even see, they were just trying to check if we have that or not. They were not checking vaccination cards for other passengers though.

When we went to the airport for check-in, we came to know that our flight was 4 hours late and they said basinet seat is not available. Everything was okay for us other than not informing us for flight was late. When we asked them about our next flight connection, they had no answer about it. When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation.

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability.

878,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

891,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

893,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it.

895,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed.

The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.

My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight.

924,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating.

The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best.

Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional.

We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline.

As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day.

After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show?

931,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience.

934,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18.

As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip.

944,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
945,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name.

946,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
947,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do. Complete disgrace. Every time I fly this airline I regret it.",NA,Business,Economy Class,Mumbai to New York,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Mangalore,Feb-23,2,4,1,NA,4,NA,4,yes
949,5th March 2023,Horrible service,Not Verified ,"  Horrible service, the aircraft had a technical issue and no one informed the passengers about the fault.

951,3rd March 2023,Service gone so down,Trip Verified ,"  I was flying with my friends, flight was packed. None of seat screen was working, no one listening to say sorry about this. When food was serving, staff were asking all what would you like have Veg or Non veg? As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.  Service gone so down - very poor when they charge a lot. Not worth money to spend on Air India.",Boeing 787-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Amritsar,Mar-23,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Return flight changed 1 day before (text and phonecall) Actually to a better time but on the day 50min delay at least 30min of which was standing in a corridor. Seat was creaky and uncomfortable.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering. Not a good value for money considering the tickets are so expensive.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangalore to Delhi,Mar-23,1,3,2,2,2,NA,1,no

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing!

955,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
956,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

959,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

964,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger.

She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line?

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable.

In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

Seats were poorly maintained in both sectors to and from AI 144 - from EWR to BOM ( Seat No 37 C) AI 191 - from BOM to EWR ( Seat No 39D) Seats : Broken / no USB connectors / no flight entertainment overall very bad experience. Food : For the money paid and for preselected option at the time of booking you are given what is available on flight.

Change of date of flying on short notice and worst the message wasn't updated and showed the original date of flying, change of route, instead of my non stop flight, the airline changed with stop over. Delay of take off for more than 5 hrs and not even a single refreshment or water served while waiting more than 1 hr seated in aircraft.

991,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

993,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

994,8th January 2023,Air India is disgusting,Trip Verified ,  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Surat,Jan-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
995,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

You’d never come across a staff smiling (ground or air), the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the Govt owned airline. Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

1028,5th April 2023,reluctant to help in any way,Not Verified ,  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India. There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline. They simply said we cannot help you.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi,Dec-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,1,no

As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show?

1031,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

1034,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

1044,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
1045,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name.

1046,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok.

1047,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious.

The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference!

1055,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight.

1056,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days.

She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help.

1064,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear.

After not getting a response for an hour after pressing the call button, I asked a flight attendant passing by about my query. She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

They were asking for extra Money (15$ Usd) for luggage which we checked in for baby.

Everything was okay for us other than not informing us for flight was late. When we asked them about our next flight connection, they had no answer about it. When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation.

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability.

1078,9th February 2023,its prices are reasonable,Trip Verified ,"  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

1091,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

1093,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work.

It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it.

1095,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers.

Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed.

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

The flight was delayed to the point that  every passenger missed their connecting flights. On top of this i had another flight from New York to Vancouver the next day which I missed and had a book a new flight for 400$. I talked to the airline staff and they said that the flight to Vancouver is not with their airline so they couldn't provide me any compensation. They didn't even care to look for any other flights from Amritsar to Delhi to help the passengers catch their connecting flights.

When I pressed the buzzer for assistance it went unanswered for 40 minutes and eventually had to get someone, despite crew resetting the screens they remained broken and they didn't offer any further assistance.

The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.

My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight.

Onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wife's worked, touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work. Headphones are not provided, both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them. They said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years. Food was bad and Rice was undercooked. No hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers.

1124,11th April 2023,Air India are idling,Trip Verified ," Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,Mar-23,4,3,2,1,4,NA,2,yes

The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional.

There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline.

As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show?

1131,2nd April 2023,The flight experience was horrible,Not Verified ,"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",Boeing 787-8 (Dreamliner),Family Leisure,Economy Class,Narita to Delhi,Apr-23,2,3,2,1,5,NA,2,no

1134,25th March 2023,amazing legroom,Not Verified ," Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18. I really want to understand - what service these guys are maintaining.

I had an additional luggage for which they made me pay $400CAD for only one 23kg bag, which unacceptable. As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time.

1144,14th March 2023,Appalling airline,Trip Verified ,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Mar-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
1145,13th March 2023,No accountability or professionalism,Trip Verified ,"  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Nairobi,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
1146,12th March 2023,Complete disaster,Trip Verified ," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",NA,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,Feb-23,3,5,3,1,1,NA,2,no
1147,11th March 2023,A total disgrace,Trip Verified ,"  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

1148,9th March 2023,the seats did not recline,Not Verified ,"  The flight was on-time, leg room was not bad, the in-flight stewardesses were attentive, check-in was efficient with the generous baggage allowance (one of the main reasons, I opted for Air India) and baggage was delivered promptly. However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Mangalore,Feb-23,2,4,1,NA,4,NA,4,yes
1149,5th March 2023,Horrible service,Not Verified ,"  Horrible service, the aircraft had a technical issue and no one informed the passengers about the fault.

1151,3rd March 2023,Service gone so down,Trip Verified ,"  I was flying with my friends, flight was packed. None of seat screen was working, no one listening to say sorry about this. When food was serving, staff were asking all what would you like have Veg or Non veg? As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.

Return flight changed 1 day before (text and phonecall) Actually to a better time but on the day 50min delay at least 30min of which was standing in a corridor. Seat was creaky and uncomfortable. Food was below average quality. Service was polite and efficient.

The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering. Not a good value for money considering the tickets are so expensive.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangalore to Delhi,Mar-23,1,3,2,2,2,NA,1,no

Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing!

1155,2nd March 2023,beyond a horrible experience,Trip Verified ,"  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi via Mumbai,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
1156,1st March 2023,service was quite nice,Trip Verified ," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Mumbai,Mar-23,5,5,4,NA,3,NA,4,yes

1159,25th February 2023,Cabin crew were extremely rude.,Trip Verified ,"  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected!

Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had!

Said no to that and then finally the manager said she would get me on a seat the next day, while looking into that she said one seat had become vacant since a passenger had dropped out, finally after 2.5 hrs, got a boarding pass, only to find that the flight had 7 empty seats. On the flight after a small snack, no food was served for the next thirteen hours, since I was hungry asked for a sandwich.

1164,22nd February 2023,do avoid at all costs,Trip Verified ," Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger. This is surely not tailored for a Western traveller, do avoid at all costs and pay the extra 500 dollars, it's worth it.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Melbourne via Delhi,Feb-23,1,1,1,1,1,NA,1,no

After not getting a response for an hour after pressing the call button, I asked a flight attendant passing by about my query. She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it.

To my surprise I had to wait for longer time than people who did not do check on line as there were more counter for people who did not do the on line so it was a big failure on part of Air India.

Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable.

In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight.

1191,12th January 2023,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Not Verified ,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",NA,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Ahmedabad,Dec-22,2,1,NA,1,1,NA,1,no

1193,10th January 2023,2 day delay in our travel plan,Trip Verified ,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again.",NA,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi,Jan-23,1,1,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
1194,8th January 2023,Air India is disgusting,Trip Verified ,  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Surat,Jan-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no
1195,8th January 2023,does not reflect well on the new owners,Trip Verified ," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers. I have already had 2 negative experiences travelling on the airline within the space of 2 months.",A320 neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Jan-23,4,4,4,NA,3,NA,4,no
1196,8th January 2023,check in was chaotic and unorganised,Trip Verified ," This is our national carrier and unfortunately one of the worst and most unprofessional airlines. You’d never come across a staff smiling (ground or air), the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the Govt owned airline. Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available. Pathetic service and they do not deserve any sympathy.",NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Kolkata via New Delhi,Jun-22,1,1,1,1,1,NA,1,no
1197,6th January 2023,,Trip Verified ,  Excellent food on the Hyderabad to London leg but food on the return leg was just ordinary. Excellent cabin crew. Special mention needs to be made of Ms Padma who was so caring and helpful on both legs of the journey. The entertainment system was not working on either legs. Punctuality was excellent. Toilets were well maintained and the pilots were superb. It was a smooth take off and landing on both legs.

1198,3rd January 2023,dirty seats and covers,Trip Verified ,"  Food quality poor. Tv screen not working. When requested to the Purser for looking into this, it was a very casual answer. They rebooted but never worked. The answer was cannot do anything. But is it not airline responsibility to ensure all facilities are working.

1199,2nd January 2023,Most disgusting service,Trip Verified ,  My bag did not come off the plane. There was no reason given. There has been no updates. There has been no feedback. I am on Day 2 without a bag in a foreign country. They haven't provided any compensation for me not having my medication or clothing. They had time for me to sign an indemnity but they couldn't care less what is happening to me without my bags. Most disgusting service and worst airline ever.,NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Goa to Mumbai,Jan-23,1,1,1,NA,1,NA,1,no
